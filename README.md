# AI Recommendation

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

A mini-popup interactive chatbot that display news(politics, sports, education, business and others); website layout,content and presentation based primarily on the results of the users' interaction with the bot


## Background

There is the problem of users having to look for news content for their location/region by clicking on the sub-domain for their country. There is also the issue of users being presented with inappropriate content(as regards their current location and culture)

## How is it used?

In this solution, a bot will be created which would be fed with IP addressing and cultures and conversation intelligence. As more and more content is added upon the website and users continnue to visit the website, content is juggled to present to the user relevant content based on their location and culture.

## Data sources and AI methods
Data can come from various APIs and we would be supplying some ourselves.

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
